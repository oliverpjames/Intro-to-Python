    "First, however, we take a look at our method of coding Python.  We have been typing Python into cells and executing it in these Notebooks.  However, as alluded to at the start of the course, this type of interactive coding is really only sufficient for writing and testing short snippets of code.  It may not have escaped your notice that the amount of coding required to execute each of our tasks has started to increase, and we will therefore now switch to writing scripts in stand-alone files, and executing them in the IPython interactive terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run IPython, open a new terminal (on SPECTRE, go to Applications > System Tools > Terminal) and type `ipython`.  The IPython interpreter will load, providing an interactive environment for typing code and running scripts.

On a Mac, TextMate 2 and TextWrangler are free and fairly decent, and on Windows, Notepad++ is also free and not terrible.  You may hear people wax lyrical about the relative benefits of editors called vi and emacs.  These programs have many advanced features, but are not needed for this course.

    "In Section 8 we saw that Matplotlib can run animations. This can be used to produce simple physics simulations.  Let's take a look at this.  The following is some code that can in principle be run in this Notebook, but you should copy and paste this into a file (you can can choose the name, but something like `bounce.py` would be suitable) and run it from the interpreter as discussed above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic premise is the following.  An object, e.g. a ball, is represented by a shape plotted on a Matplotlib Axis at a particular location $(x,y)$.  The position of the shape is then updated by a function repeatedly called by `FuncAnimation`, according to the governing equations.  So, for a ball falling under gravity, we have the acceleration $g_y=-9.81\\;\\mathrm{ms^{-2}}$, and  if we run a loop in which we update the time $t$ each time by a small amount $\\Delta t$, we can update the velocity and position of the ball as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{y1} = v_{y0} + g\\Delta t$$\n",
    "$$y_1 = y_0 + v_{y1}\\Delta t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{x1} = v_{x0}$$\n",
    "$$x_1 = x_0 + v_{x1}\\Delta t\\;\\;.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the acceleration due to gravity is solely in the vertical direction, such that the horizontal component of the velocity is constant. In this example, however, we have also introduced 'walls' at the edges of the plot, at which point the horizontal component is reversed in order that the ball doesn't immediately disappear off the edge of the screen.  We have also introduced a coefficient of restitution - when the ball's central position is detected to be less than one radius above the floor (at $y=0$) or away from either wall, the relevant component of the velocity is reversed and reduced in magnitude by a small factor. The simulation will run until you close the plot window. "

Use a timestep (`dt` in the above code) of ~5 h and a refresh rate (`interval` in the above code) of 1 ms (i.e. = 1).  Initial velocities of order a 100 m/s should produce a decent orbit.
