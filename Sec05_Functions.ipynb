The first line that is executed is line 6, in which `x` is defined as 2. This is passed into function `squareit`, which defines a new variable (purposefully!) also called `x`, which is the square of the variable that was passed in.  This is returned, and printed. The returned value is 4, and the final `print x` line indicates that at this point `x` is 2. So, it is clear that, although we are defining a variable called `x` in the function `squareit`, this value is *not* retained when execution returns out of the function, and `x` is back to the value we defined it as on line 6.  Hence the scope of the `x` in the function `squareit` is only that function - not outside of it.\n",
