These languages are \"*statically-typed*\", which means that a variable type cannot be changed once it's created - once an int always an int - but Python is an example of a \"*dynamically-typed*\" language, in which the type of a variable can be assigned and changed as required by the operation that is being executed.  This requires testing of data types and assigning memory on the fly, slowing the code down.

    "What does \"identifiers\" mean? In the above, we have used variable names (`a`, `b`, etc.) to refer to objects stored in the computer's memory, each of which have their own type, `int`, `float`, `string`, etc.  The variable names are called *identifiers*, and, along with the type are a second attribute of an object.  Identifiers can be of any length, and can contain letters (a-z), numerals (0-9), and underscores (_), although they must begin with either a letter or an underscore, and they are case sensitive, i.e. `a!=A`.\n",

    "ncount = 3<br/><br/>\n",
    "However, do not truncate words too much without liberal use of *comments*, which are dealt with below. Also, do not start identifiers with underscores *unless you are sure that you know what you are doing*, as many of these have special meanings. It is desirable to avoid simply using a lower case \"l\" for Lima, upper case \"O\" for Oscar and upper case \"I\" for Indigo, as these can look like the numbers 1 and 0 in some fonts.  Finally, make sure your identifiers do not replicate either system variables or names used for Modules or functions - the latter comes with practice, as you learn more of these (and indeed write your own!).\n",

    "What we are doing is that we are first assigning the identifier `a` to an integer object, whose value is 5. We then assign `b` to point to the same integer object as does `a`, not the indentifier `a` itself. Hence, after we re-assign the identifer `a` to a different integer object, whose value is 25, `b` still points to the original integer object held in the computer's memory.  This object will stay in the computer's memory until it is no longer assigned to any identifier, when it is automatically expunged by Python's *garbage collection* process. This subtlety becomes particularly important when we are dealing with more complex objects than `int`s, and when we are passing data between different parts of the code."
